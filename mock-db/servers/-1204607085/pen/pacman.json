The use of `transform` properties, such as `rotateY` and `translateZ`, brings Pac-Man and the maze to life in a 3D space. This technique demonstrates how far CSS has evolved, enabling developers to create complex animations without relying on heavy JavaScript libraries.\n\n## Canvas for Game Mechanics\n\nAs the animation concludes, the scene transitions into a playable game, implemented using the HTML5 Canvas API. Canvas offers the flexibility needed for rendering game graphics on the fly. It's particularly well-suited for a dynamic game like Pac-Man, where the environment changes rapidly in real-time.\n\n## AI-Driven Ghosts\n\nWhat sets this game apart is the AI behind the ghosts. Each ghost uses a simple yet effective AI algorithm to chase Pac-Man, making strategic decisions based on his position. The algorithm takes into account walls and distance, adding a challenging twist to the gameplay.\n\n## Smooth Animations with JavaScript\n\nThe smooth movement of Pac-Man and the ghosts, along with the game's interactivity, is achieved through JavaScript. By combining CSS animations for the 3D effect and JavaScript for game mechanics, the project showcases a harmonious blend of web technologies.\n\nIn conclusion, this CodePen project not only pays homage to a classic game but also pushes the boundaries of what's possible in web development today. It's a perfect example of how creativity and technology can come together to create something both nostalgic and innovative.\n\n*Stay tuned for more posts about innovative web development projects and techniques.*",
