# Routes

In the second step in converting our SPA to a NextJS application we're going to move from a traditional router (`react-router-dom`) to NextJS file-based routing.

This will include the following steps:

1. Look at the original routes and determine what kind of route they will be in nextjs
2. Create the appropriate directories/files
3. Move content of the component over
4. Add dependencies as needed
5. Add `'use client'` (temporary)
