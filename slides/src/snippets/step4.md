# Route handlers

In this step we're going to move one of the endpoints currently hosted by our mock-api, to ournextjs application.

NextJS allows us to execute code on the server, meaning that we no longer need an API server.

In this step we're going to do a fairly simple substitution, exchanging one URL with another. But in the next step we'll see we can simplify this even further.

The API endpoint to replace will be: `http://localhost:1234/api/email`
