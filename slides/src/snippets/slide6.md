# What are Meta frameworks?

This workshop is focused on NextJS, but it should help understand concepts that apply to other server-side-rendering solutions also (such as Nuxt for Vue, Analog for Angular, SvelteKit for Svelte, SolidStart for SolidJS).

With a traditional 'framework' (or library):

- You generate code that can be hosted on a webserver

With a meta-framework like NextJS:

- The webserver is included as integral part
- The framework facilitates API routes, caching, does the server side rendering
