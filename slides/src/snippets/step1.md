# Layout & Home

This will be the first step in converting our SPA to a NextJS application.

We're going to move from a traditional router (`react-router-dom`) to NextJS file-based routing.

This will include the following steps:

1. Copy public folder
2. Transferring the index.html to the layout component
3. Moving the SPA layout to the Next app (use `next/link` and `href` for navigation)
4. Copy home component to the root page.tsx
5. Add `'use client'` (temporary)
